# User Experience - Input methods for value selection
## Problem
When creating an user interface we often want the user to select one or multiple values from a 
list of predefined values.

## Possible solutions
* For well known values (e.g. Country selection): Input with autocomplete / dropdown with input
* For small list of discrete values: Slider
* For dates: Date picker
* For small list of values: Segmented control (horizontal or vertical)
* For small list of values: Radio buttons
* For hierarchy of values: Checkbox tree
* Checkbox list
* Dropdown/Select
